# Eco ModKit

Greetings Citizens!

This repository is home to some examples of mods that can be created with Eco's ModKit. If you're just getting started check the [Wiki](https://wiki.play.eco/en/Mod_Development) for more details.

Current examples:
* [Blockset](Examples/Blockset) - A blockset that creates gree stained glass windows
* [DiscordAccessMod](Examples/DiscordAccessMod) - An example mod that uses Discord roles to give whitelist access using ``IUserAuthorizer``.
* [EchoCommand](Examples/EchoCommand) - A chat command that echos back the message you give it
* [EcopediaPage](Examples/EcopediaPage) - An Ecopedia Page that adds a rules page for servers
* [Flag](Examples/Flag) - A flag object with animation that can be turned of and off

If you have a suggestion for a new example mod you would like to see, or for some new functionality in the modkit for something you're trying to do, head over to [issues](https://github.com/StrangeLoopGames/EcoModKit/issues) and let us know!
